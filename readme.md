# BU Course Scraper

## About

This is a web scraper that scrapes the BU course catalog and outputs the data into a csv file.

This sub-project is part of my ongoing project to create a course recommender for BU students.

The data scraped from this project will be used to populate a database that will suggest courses to students based on their missing hub units.

## Usage

To use this scraper, clone / fork the repository and run `
npm run build`, then `npm run start`. The csv file will be outputted into the root directory. under the name `courses.csv`.

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Puppeteer
- Cheerio
